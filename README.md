# Prompt Engineering for Developers by Using Ollama Model
This is the revised version of coursera ["chatgpt prompt engineering for developers"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-for-developers-project) lessons, originally it uses chatgpt as LLM model, here I changed the model to any Ollama supported model for the lessons of this course, so that anyone who doesn't have chatgpt api-key can practise it locally.

## dependency
Ollama need to install and run on your machine, and at least one model should be pulled. Specify the pulled model name in utils.py
